2012-08-31 02:01:08	 *	brian2040 [01:23:08] just got the word. He's moving to Atlanta
2012-08-31 02:01:08	corp769	[01:25:44] setkeh: what phone do you have?
2012-08-31 02:01:08	+setkeh	[01:28:36] HTC Evo 3D
2012-08-31 02:01:08	corp769	[01:30:03] ahh ok
2012-08-31 02:01:08	corp769	[01:30:07] how do you like it?
2012-08-31 02:01:08	oscailt	[01:31:13] (https://dl.dropbox.com/u/86784997/music/haydaniaHummel-GagaWithADifference.ogg
2012-08-31 02:01:08	oscailt	[01:31:22] Made that track in LMMS
2012-08-31 02:01:08	oscailt	[01:31:27] First time ever using it
2012-08-31 02:01:08	oscailt	[01:31:45] Quite proud of it.
2012-08-31 02:01:08	+setkeh	[01:34:33] 3D cammera is kinda pointless as is the 3D screen but a fantastic phone otherwise
2012-08-31 02:01:08	 *	c_smith [01:35:12] will brb, breakfast
2012-08-31 02:01:08	corp769	[01:35:39] oscailt: the sound quality honestly is kinda... ehh
2012-08-31 02:01:08	oscailt	[01:38:30] corp769: Yeah I know :(
2012-08-31 02:01:08	oscailt	[01:38:50] Working on it. First attempt though. It's a little loud that's all.
2012-08-31 02:01:08	corp769	[01:39:32] yeah pretty much
2012-08-31 02:01:08	corp769	[01:39:53] and also, the beginning lead notes sound too high for the rhythm
2012-08-31 02:01:08	corp769	[01:40:14] try taking them down an octave and see how it sounds, might blend together better
2012-08-31 02:01:08	oscailt	[01:41:21] It's been a long time since I've composed. Last time was about 5 years ago and all that stuff was classical
2012-08-31 02:01:08	corp769	[01:41:35] ahh ok
2012-08-31 02:01:08	oscailt	[01:42:40] But meh. First time using LMMS and i just wanted to show it's power
2012-08-31 02:01:08	corp769	[01:43:53] oh ok
2012-08-31 02:01:08	corp769	[01:44:03] i havent used lmms in a while either lol
2012-08-31 02:01:08	oscailt	[01:44:44] It's actually not that bad. I mean I was able to get that realively "complex" beat made in under 3 days
2012-08-31 02:01:08	corp769	[01:44:50] not bad
2012-08-31 02:01:08	c_smith	[01:46:50] heya
2012-08-31 02:01:08	corp769	[01:52:12] hey c_smith
2012-08-31 02:01:08	c_smith	[01:55:42] how's things?
2012-08-31 02:01:08	 *	c_smith [01:55:55] enjoys some FFDP (Five Finger Death Punch)
2012-08-31 02:01:08	+setkeh	[01:56:28] FFDP is awesome
2012-08-31 02:01:08	c_smith	[01:57:57] it is.
2012-08-31 02:01:08	c_smith	[01:58:03] *they are

2012-08-31 02:02:30	c_smith	yep, he obviously didn't take several things into account when writing his blog post.
2012-08-31 02:02:50	oscailt	c_smith: People at GNOME have gone crazy
2012-08-31 02:03:06	c_smith	one being Canonical, another being the fact the Linux being a Niche OS is only relative to comparison.
2012-08-31 02:03:12	c_smith	oscailt, yeah, true.
